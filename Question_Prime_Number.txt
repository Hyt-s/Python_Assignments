QUESTION :

Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints the result to check if it is a prime number.

The examples of the desired output are as follows :

input →  19 ⇉ output : 19 is a prime number
input →  10 ⇉ output : 10 is not a prime number


ANSWER-1:


n = int(input("Enter a number to check if it is a prime number : "))
count = 0

for i in range(1, n + 1) :
  if not n % i :
    count += 1

if (n == 0) or (n == 1) or (count >= 3) :
  print(n, "is not a prime number.")
else:
  print(n, "is a prime number.")


ANSWER-2:

number = int(input("Enter a number to learn if it is a prime number : "))
count = 0

for i in range(3, number, 2):  # only odd numbers has taken
  if number % i == 0:
    count += 1
    break
  if number // i < i:  # done for not repeat of division
    break

if number == 0 or number == 1 or (number % 2 == 0 and number !=2) or count > 0:
  print(number, "is not a prime number")
else:
  print(number, "is a prime number")
