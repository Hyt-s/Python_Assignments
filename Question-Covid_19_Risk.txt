QUESTION :

Task : 

Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus. Write a program that;

--Takes "Yes" or "No" from the user as an answer to the following questions :

--Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age

--Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic

--Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune

Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and use if-statements with the given variables in order to print out us a message : "You are in risky group"(if True ) or "You are not in risky group" (if False).

	age =  # can be assigned only True/False
	chronic =  # can be assigned only True/False
	immune =  # can be assigned only True/False
	risk = ?


ANSWER :

age = input("Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old?\
      (Yes or No): ").title()
chronic = input("Do you have severe chronic disease? (Yes or No): ").title()
immune = input("Is your immune system too weak? (Yes or No): ").title()


if age == "Yes":
  age = True
else:
  age = False

if chronic == "Yes":
  chronic = True
else:
  chronic = False

if immune == "Yes":
  immune = True
else:
  immune = False

if age or chronic or immune:
  print("You are in risky group")
else:
  print("You are not in risky group")
