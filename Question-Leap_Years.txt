QUESTION :

Task:

Find out if a given year is a "leap" year.

In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
 1. The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
 2. If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year; unless...
 3. The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not the leap years.

Write a Python program that prints such as "2020 is a leap year" if the given year by the user is a leap year, prints such as "2019 is not a leap year" otherwise.


ANSWER :

year = int(input("Enter a year : "))

if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0:
  print(f"{year} is a leap year")
elif year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 == 0:
  print(f"{year} is a leap year")
else:
  print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
